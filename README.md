# Introduction

An example of a modern Rust rocket application using [OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)) for authentication/authorisation with SvelteKit for developing the frontend:
* [backend](./backend) - Contains the backend implemented in Rust Rocket
* [frontend](./frontend) - Contains the frontend implemented in SvelteKit

You will find further documentation (e.g. building, configuring etc.) in the corresponding subfolders.

We also [explain how you can integrate it with an OIDC IdP by using Codeberg.org](./backend/docs/EXAMPLE-CODEBERG-OIDC.md) as an identity provider.

This example project is supposed to be easily reused, so you can build your own complex application.
